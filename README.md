# Bio
I'm currently a Master's student at Stony Brook University in the Computer Science Department with focus on Data Science, Machine Learning and am actively looking for internship opportunities in Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Data Engineering.

I have worked on several projects which can be seen from my resume [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1C2BG05GVFCm-d9lCcSMDerba9pNPr97f/view?usp=sharing). These projects have given me a basic insight into the world of drawing insights to drive businesses and understand the needs of the company.

# Ongoing Research under [Prof. Christian Luhmann](https://cluhmann.github.io/)
Objective :- To understand the flow of false memory and how collective memory plays a role in this. 
Progress : -In this we are starting with understanding how collective memory work. We are currently trying to replicate the working on [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8171) paper and using our own metrics of recall and inhibition to show the flow of collective memory. Next we plan to also incorporate the literature on false memory and how can it infect and flow in collective memory.
