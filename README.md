# Bio
I'm currently a Ph.D. student at Missouri University of Science and Technology (MS&T) under the guidance of Prof Sanjay K. Madria. I have completed my Master's degree in Computer Science from Stony Brook University. My focus areas are Data Science, Data Analytics, Machine Learning, Graph Neural Networks and their applications.

I have worked on numerous personal and academic projects relating to the different applications in the housing industry (AMES Housing), Fraud detection (IEEE Fraud Detection) and Sales Analysis (Retail Sales Analysis). These projects have gave me an insight into how can ML and DL techniques be used to impact the betterment of the world we live in.

Objective :- To understand the flow of false memory and how collective memory plays a role in this. 
Progress : -In this we are starting with understanding how collective memory work. We are currently trying to replicate the working on [this](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/29/8171) paper and using our own metrics of recall and inhibition to show the flow of collective memory. Next we plan to also incorporate the literature on false memory and how can it infect and flow in collective memory.  

# Personal Projects
1. [Retail Sales Analysis](https://github.com/AbhayGoyal/Retail-Sales_Analysis)
  * To perform descriptive analytics and models to increase sales.
2. [AMES Housing Project](https://www.kaggle.com/golion/dsf-2/)
  * Analysed and understood the factors affecting house prices and made model to predict them.
3. [IEEE Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/golion/abhaygoyal-dsf)
  * Analysed and did in depth analysis of frauds, how do they occur and when
4. [Bank Marketing](https://github.com/AbhayGoyal/Bank_Marketing/)
  * Analysed to predict(using Logistic Regression, Random Forest) what policies would people take based on features such as did, what they tak last time, salary, housing etc
5. [HR Analytics](https://github.com/AbhayGoyal/HR-Analytics/)
  * Did some basic visualizations do understand the satisfaction level of employees, used linear regression to predict it.
6. [Dashboard using D3.js](https://github.com/AbhayGoyal/HR-Analytics/)
  * To visualize and understand the adoption of DS and ML methods of organizations and individuals using the ML & DS Survey 2019
